# Iterative1_snakegame
 
Design hypothesis:

The design hypothesis for this game is to explore how the snake game can be explored further from its original design and concept. This game combines two different classic games which are the snake game and find the difference. The find the difference is where the player will have to find the different cube on the pattern full floor to move on to the next level. As the player levels up, finding the cube will become harder and harder along aside with a faster movement of the character.

Design Journal Entries:

Playtester 1:
 - Instead of just having the character move around, make a grid like the original snake game. 
 - The collecting of the food does not work properly.
 - The character is cool. 
 - The long character tail should be done so it gets more intense when the player turns. So when the character touches its tail, it dies. 
 - The cube concept of finding is a cool idea.
 
 
Playtester 2:
 - The speed and the movement of the character are good.
 - If each level will have different types of speed, the character should also change. 
 - Maybe adding different shapes of the floor would be more fun. Level one is square but level 2 can be a circle. And the player will have to move around to find the cube. 
 
 Playtester 3:
  - To make it more engaging add sound effects and scores. This will keep people motivated. 
  - Having some sort of feedback is needed.
  - The speed and movement are good. 
  - Having a starter instructions page is needed, in order to know what to do. 
  - Also having different controls on different levels could be interesting. 
  - This playtester also agrees with different floor shapes as the player moves up in levels. 
  
Playtester 4:
 - Had a hard time finding the main objective of the game. 
 - Added the instruction page is needed. 
 - Had a hard time finding the cube hidden in the floor pattern, so having level 1 - easy would be better so the player can understand what they are doing. 
 - Making the cube move randomly on the same level is interesting because it creates more motivation. 
 - Right now the game is boring. 
 - Add more obstacles like walls.
 - Movement is good - smooth and clean.
 
 
Playtester 5:
 - The movement is too slow - give them the option to go faster like using the shift key. 
 - Objective is not clear.
 - Instruction page is needed.
 - Instead of moving with a mouse, using the keyboard is good. 
 - After getting the cube the tail grows longer.
 - Having different shapes for floors for different floors will make the game more dynamic. 
 
Playtester 6:
 - Let the player get used to the control. 
 - Let the character grow bigger (by the tail or getting fat).
 - Increase the speed
 - different levels in different environments. 
 - different sky and environment. 
 - Give texture to the character also so it does not stand out too much. 
 
Playtester 7:
 - The control is confusing
 - Cute character though
 - Movement is slow but it is good for level one. 
 - Maybe the camera position changes as the level changes. 
 - It gets fat or the tail gets longer. 
 - Different textures for both the character and the floor. 
 - The different floor shapes are interesting but it could be a lot and challenging if they change constantly after each level. 
 
 
Reflection on the result of the playtester:

The playtester was very helpful since it give me a lot of different ideas on how to improve this game and make it more interesting and engaging. The result of the design hypothesis was good. The 'snake game' and 'finding the difference' game combination is a good idea. It will give much more depth to different levels. The big outcome of the playtest was the concept of having different floor shapes for different levels. I think this would make the game more enjoyable and exciting. It will create interesting camera angles too if I can figure out how to do that.
