Design hypothesis:

For the red button game, my design hypothesis is ‘at what extent will the player go in order to win the game?’ Since my game idea is to only let the player win the game when they hit the red button however the game instruction will warn them to not do that. The instruction says not to hit the red button but it also says to do whatever to win the game. The player will have to explore around and see for hits to win the game but all the hits will lead to pressing the red button. So, my hypothesis will test the user's reaction and actions.
